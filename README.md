About a prototype task management system that I also use for my personal task management. 
Main idea of the system is being able to design task process steps in a tailor-made fashion.

Task management tools (apps or other software) usually consist of Completed and Non-completed options. 
However, some tasks may require other steps in-between such as completion rates of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. 
Groovy (Taskify) offers the users this flexibility. 

User may design her/his process and the steps to be passed over according to needs; and then assign a task according to these steps. 
Once there is a progress on the task, appropriate progress level is updated on the system. 
All updates on the process steps are separately recorded as logs which may also be used for task management analysis especially from duration point of view.

The app also includes a calendar module, where tasks can be assigned to dates on the calendar. 
The calendar module can also be used completely as a separate calendar tool which enables user to add or delete calendar events.

There is also a module for routine tasks on the app. 
Once a routine task is defined, it is seen on the screen of routine tasks and once this task is marked as 'completed', a new task for the next month is automatically assigned on the system.
